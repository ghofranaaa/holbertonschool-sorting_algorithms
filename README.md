Sorting Algorithms Project
Overview
This project is aimed at implementing various sorting algorithms in C programming language. The implemented algorithms are meant to sort arrays of integers and doubly linked lists of integers in ascending order. The primary focus of this project is to understand sorting algorithms, analyze their time complexities using Big O notation, and apply them effectively.

Sorting Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort

Description: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Insertion Sort

Description: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Selection Sort

Description: Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n^2)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Quick Sort

Description: Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Usage
To use the implemented sorting algorithms in your project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the sorting algorithms.
Compile the C files using the provided Makefile or compile manually using gcc.
Include the necessary header file sort.h in your source code.
Call the respective sorting function with the array or linked list to be sorted.
